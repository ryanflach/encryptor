# encryptor
Completed Jumpstart Lab ROT encryption and decryption tutorial.

`encryptor.rb` houses the main class and methods, while `enc_pw_check.rb` utilizes the password check and main user interface. Ideas for `enc_pw_check.rb` were inspired by another GitHub repo (https://github.com/cherimarie/encryptor) of the same tutorial, though it has been modified substantially.

The `encrypt` and `decrypt` methods take only one argument in this build, rather than the two outlined in the tutorial. This is because this version goes through all additional challenges outlined (i.e., using three set numbers that rotate through as the rotation value when performing the encryption or decryption).
